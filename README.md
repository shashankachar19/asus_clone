# AI Frontend Challenge: The Zero-Shot Benchmarks

This repository is a head-to-head comparison of the frontend architectural capabilities of three leading AI models: **Gemini**, **Claude**, and **v0**.

## 🎯 The Experiment
The goal is to evaluate how accurately these models can replicate a complex, high-end hardware website (ASUS TUF/ROG) using a **Zero-Shot Prompting** strategy. 

> **Zero-Shot Definition:** Only one single, detailed prompt was provided to each model. No follow-up corrections, no iterative styling, and no manual bug fixes were allowed. 

## 🤖 Models Benchmarked
1.  **Gemini (Google)**: View `gemini.html`
2.  **Claude (Anthropic)**: View `claude.html`
3.  **v0 (Vercel)**: View code in `v0_output/` (or corresponding html)

## ⚡ Key Observations
To be honest, the code generated by all three models is remarkably high-quality for a single-turn interaction. Each model prioritized different aspects:
* **Gemini**: Focused on interactive stability, lightweight libraries (Alpine.js), and distinct brand-specific animations (like the scanline effect).
* **Claude**: Traditionally strong at logical component structure and clean Tailwind utility usage.
* **v0**: Highly specialized in React-centric components and modern UI patterns.

## 💻 Tech Stack Used Across Models
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling)
- **JavaScript** (Alpine.js / React / Framer Motion)
- **Lucide Icons** (Scalable UI Icons)
